# Module 1: TypeScript Fundamentals

## Core Problem
JavaScript lacks static typing, which can lead to runtime errors that are difficult to debug. TypeScript solves this by adding static type checking while maintaining JavaScript's flexibility.

## Key Assumptions
- You have basic JavaScript knowledge
- You understand programming fundamentals
- You have Node.js installed on your system

## Essential Concepts

### 1. TypeScript Philosophy & Advantages

**Concise Explanation:**  
TypeScript is a strongly-typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It provides optional static typing, class-based object-oriented programming, and tooling that helps catch errors before runtime.

**Where to Use:**
- Large-scale applications where type safety is critical
- Teams working on shared codebases
- Projects that need strong IDE support and tooling
- Applications requiring robust error checking

**Code Snippet:**
```typescript
// JavaScript - No type safety
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
add("5", 10); // Returns "510" (string concatenation)

// TypeScript - With type safety
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
add("5", 10); // Error: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'
```

**Real-World Example:**  
Microsoft built VS Code (over 300,000 lines of code) using TypeScript. The type system helped them maintain and refactor their codebase with confidence, reducing bugs during major feature updates.

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Overtyping everything: TypeScript has excellent type inference, so you don't need to add types to every variable
- Using `any` type frequently: This defeats the purpose of type checking
- Not understanding the difference between compile-time vs runtime type checking

**Three Common Questions:**

1. **Q: Does TypeScript replace JavaScript?**  
   **A:** No. TypeScript compiles to JavaScript, which still runs in browsers and Node.js. TypeScript is a development tool that doesn't exist at runtime.

2. **Q: Will TypeScript make my application slower?**  
   **A:** No. TypeScript's type system is removed during compilation, resulting in clean JavaScript with no runtime overhead.

3. **Q: Is learning TypeScript worth the effort if I already know JavaScript?**  
   **A:** Yes. TypeScript improves code quality, maintainability, and helps catch bugs early. Most modern JavaScript frameworks have first-class TypeScript support.

### 2. TypeScript vs JavaScript: Superset Relationship

**Concise Explanation:**  
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, meaning all valid JavaScript code is valid TypeScript code. TypeScript adds features like static typing, interfaces, and enhanced tooling on top of JavaScript's foundation.

**Where to Use:**
- When migrating JavaScript projects to TypeScript incrementally
- When working with existing JavaScript libraries
- When you need to mix typed and untyped code temporarily

**Code Snippet:**
```typescript
// Valid JavaScript and TypeScript
let name = "John";
const greet = () => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
};

// Valid TypeScript only
let age: number = 30;
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}
const user: User = { name, age };
```

**Real-World Example:**  
Slack migrated their desktop application from JavaScript to TypeScript incrementally. They started by adding .ts files alongside their .js files, gradually converting parts of the codebase while maintaining functionality.

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Assuming all JavaScript patterns work the same way in TypeScript
- Not using `--allowJs` flag when integrating TypeScript into JavaScript projects
- Forcing immediate full conversion instead of incremental adoption

**Three Common Questions:**

1. **Q: Can I mix .js and .ts files in the same project?**  
   **A:** Yes. TypeScript projects can include both file types, allowing for gradual migration.

2. **Q: Do I need to add types to every JavaScript file I convert?**  
   **A:** No. TypeScript allows you to add types incrementally. You can use implicit `any` types initially with the `--noImplicitAny` flag turned off.

3. **Q: Will TypeScript limit what I can do compared to JavaScript?**  
   **A:** Rarely. TypeScript's type system is designed to be flexible. For the few cases where dynamic JavaScript patterns can't be typed statically, TypeScript provides escape hatches like `any` and type assertions.

### 3. Setting up the TypeScript Environment

**Concise Explanation:**  
Setting up TypeScript involves installing the TypeScript compiler (tsc) and configuring your project with a tsconfig.json file that specifies compiler options and project settings.

**Where to Use:**
- New TypeScript projects
- When converting JavaScript projects to TypeScript
- When customizing build settings for different environments

**Code Snippet:**
```bash
# Install TypeScript globally
npm install -g typescript

# Initialize a new TypeScript project
mkdir my-ts-project
cd my-ts-project
npm init -y
npm install --save-dev typescript
npx tsc --init
```

```json
// Basic tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2020",        // ECMAScript target version
    "module": "commonjs",      // Module system
    "strict": true,            // Enable all strict type checking
    "esModuleInterop": true,   // Import non-ES modules as ES modules
    "skipLibCheck": true,      // Skip type checking of declaration files
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true, // Case sensitivity for imports
    "outDir": "./dist"         // Output directory for compiled files
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"],     // Files to include
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]  // Files to exclude
}
```

**Real-World Example:**  
Angular framework projects use a base tsconfig.json that extends with environment-specific configurations (e.g., tsconfig.app.json for the application code and tsconfig.spec.json for testing).

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Not configuring `outDir` correctly, mixing source and compiled files
- Using conflicting module settings with your runtime environment
- Setting overly strict rules at the beginning of migration
- Not including the right files in the "include" property

**Three Common Questions:**

1. **Q: What's the minimum tsconfig.json needed to start a project?**  
   **A:** A minimal configuration can be just: `{ "compilerOptions": { "target": "es2020", "module": "commonjs" } }`. However, using `tsc --init` creates a more complete starting point.

2. **Q: How do I configure TypeScript for a React/Vue/Angular project?**  
   **A:** Modern frameworks typically provide TypeScript templates, but you generally need to set: `"jsx": "react"` for React, or use the framework's CLI tools like `ng new` or `vue create` with TypeScript options.

3. **Q: What's the difference between `npm install typescript` and `npm install -g typescript`?**  
   **A:** The `-g` flag installs TypeScript globally, making `tsc` available system-wide. Installing locally (without `-g`) adds it to your project's dependencies and requires `npx tsc` to run the compiler.

### 4. TypeScript Toolchain

**Concise Explanation:**  
The TypeScript toolchain consists of the TypeScript compiler (tsc), tools for running TypeScript directly (ts-node), and various compiler options that control type checking, module generation, and output code quality.

**Where to Use:**
- Development workflows
- Continuous integration pipelines
- Build and bundling processes
- Testing environments

**Code Snippet:**
```bash
# Compile TypeScript files
tsc file.ts

# Watch mode: automatically recompile on changes
tsc --watch

# Run TypeScript directly without compiling
npx ts-node file.ts
```

```json
// Advanced compiler options in tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2020",
    "module": "esnext",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "sourceMap": true,          // Generate source maps
    "declaration": true,        // Generate .d.ts files
    "noImplicitAny": true,      // Error on implied any types
    "strictNullChecks": true,   // Strict null checking
    "noUnusedLocals": true,     // Error on unused local variables
    "removeComments": true      // Remove comments in output
  }
}
```

**Real-World Example:**  
In a CI/CD pipeline for a TypeScript project, you might have different tsconfig files: one for development with source maps and minimal optimizations, and one for production that strips comments and includes additional checks.

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Not using `--project` or `-p` flag when compiling with a tsconfig in a different directory
- Forgetting to install `ts-node` before trying to use it
- Having conflicting compiler options between tsconfig and command line
- Not understanding the performance implications of certain compiler options

**Three Common Questions:**

1. **Q: What's the difference between `tsc` and `ts-node`?**  
   **A:** `tsc` compiles TypeScript to JavaScript, while `ts-node` executes TypeScript code directly without a separate compilation step, useful for development and testing.

2. **Q: How do I exclude files from compilation?**  
   **A:** Use the `exclude` property in tsconfig.json: `"exclude": ["node_modules", "**/*.spec.ts"]`. This won't exclude files that are explicitly imported by included files.

3. **Q: What's the purpose of the `--noEmit` flag?**  
   **A:** It runs the compiler for type checking only, without generating output files. Useful for quick validation and in pre-commit hooks.

### 5. Creating and Running Your First TypeScript Program

**Concise Explanation:**  
Creating a TypeScript program involves writing code in .ts files, compiling them to JavaScript, and then running the resulting JavaScript in a runtime like Node.js or a browser.

**Where to Use:**
- Starting new TypeScript projects
- Creating TypeScript examples and tests
- Demonstrating TypeScript concepts

**Code Snippet:**
```typescript
// hello.ts
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

// Type annotations for function parameters
function calculateTax(income: number, taxRate: number): number {
  return income * taxRate;
}

// Using interfaces for complex types
interface Person {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  age: number;
}

function formatName(person: Person): string {
  return `${person.firstName} ${person.lastName}`;
}

// Using the code
const user: Person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 30
};

console.log(greet(formatName(user)));
console.log(`Tax: $${calculateTax(50000, 0.2).toFixed(2)}`);
```

```bash
# Compile and run
tsc hello.ts
node hello.js

# Or run directly with ts-node
npx ts-node hello.ts
```

**Real-World Example:**  
Developers at Airbnb created a TypeScript project template that includes the initial setup for React components, API types, and testing infrastructure, allowing new engineers to quickly start building features with proper typing.

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Forgetting to install necessary type definitions for third-party libraries
- Not compiling before running (when not using ts-node)
- Using Node.js features without the correct types or lib settings
- Overcomplicating types for simple programs

**Three Common Questions:**

1. **Q: How can I debug a TypeScript application?**  
   **A:** Use source maps (enable `sourceMap: true` in tsconfig.json) and modern IDEs like VS Code that support TypeScript debugging. Add a `launch.json` configuration that either uses ts-node or points to your compiled JS with source maps.

2. **Q: Do I need to compile TypeScript every time I make a change?**  
   **A:** No, you can use `tsc --watch` to automatically recompile on file changes, or use `ts-node` during development to run TypeScript files directly.

3. **Q: How do I handle errors like "Cannot find module" when importing files?**  
   **A:** Ensure the module exists, check your `moduleResolution` setting in tsconfig.json (usually set to "node"), and verify that the file extension is handled correctly. For non-TypeScript modules, you may need type definitions (@types/package-name).

### 6. TypeScript Module Resolution and Project Structure

**Concise Explanation:**  
Module resolution is the process TypeScript uses to find and import modules referenced in your code. Project structure involves organizing your files, defining path aliases, and managing dependencies efficiently.

**Where to Use:**
- Large TypeScript applications with many modules
- Projects with multiple packages or monorepos
- Applications that need to import from specific directories
- When refactoring code organization

**Code Snippet:**
```json
// tsconfig.json with path mapping
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "./src",
    "paths": {
      "@api/*": ["api/*"],
      "@utils/*": ["utils/*"],
      "@models/*": ["models/*"]
    },
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "outDir": "./dist"
  }
}
```

```typescript
// Using path mapping in your code
import { formatDate } from "@utils/dateUtils";
import { User } from "@models/User";
import { fetchUser } from "@api/userService";

// Project structure example
// src/
// ├── api/
// │   └── userService.ts
// ├── models/
// │   └── User.ts
// ├── utils/
// │   └── dateUtils.ts
// └── index.ts
```

**Real-World Example:**  
Next.js projects use TypeScript path aliases to simplify imports. Instead of writing `import Button from "../../../components/Button"`, developers can use `import Button from "@components/Button"`, making code more maintainable when files move.

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Misconfiguring `baseUrl` and `paths` in tsconfig.json
- Not updating module resolution when moving between ESM and CommonJS
- Circular dependencies between modules
- Forgetting to set up bundler config (webpack, etc.) to match TypeScript path aliases

**Three Common Questions:**

1. **Q: What's the difference between "classic" and "node" module resolution strategies?**  
   **A:** "classic" is the original TypeScript resolution strategy that follows a simple relative path lookup. "node" mimics Node.js resolution, including node_modules searching and package.json processing, and is recommended for most projects.

2. **Q: How do I make path aliases work with Jest testing or other tools?**  
   **A:** You need to configure each tool separately. For Jest, use `moduleNameMapper` in jest.config.js to match your tsconfig paths. For webpack, use the `resolve.alias` option.

3. **Q: How can I organize types in a large project?**  
   **A:** Create a dedicated "types" or "models" directory for shared interfaces. Use barrel files (index.ts) to re-export types from multiple files. Consider organizing types alongside their related functionality rather than centralizing everything.
