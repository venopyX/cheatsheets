2. Mutability with `mut`
3. Constants with `const`
4. Shadowing
5. Naming Conventions
6. Variable Scope
7. Default Values
8. Type Inference

## 1. Variable Declaration with `let`

### Concise Explanation
In Rust, variables are declared using the `let` keyword. By default, all variables are immutable (cannot be changed after initialization). This immutability-by-default is a core Rust principle that helps prevent bugs and enables the compiler to optimize code.

### Where to Use
- Whenever you need to store a value
- When you want to ensure a value doesn't change accidentally
- For most variable declarations in your code

### Code Snippet
```rust
fn main() {
    // Basic variable declaration
    let x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    
    // This would cause a compile error:
    // x = 6; // error: cannot assign twice to immutable variable
    
    // Multiple declarations at once
    let (name, age) = ("Alice", 30);
    println!("{} is {} years old", name, age);
}
```

### Real-World Example
In a web server, immutable variables ensure request data doesn't accidentally get modified during processing:

```rust
fn handle_request(request_id: u64, payload: &str) {
    let timestamp = chrono::Utc::now();
    let request_size = payload.len();
    
    // Log request details (these values never change)
    println!("Request #{} received at {} with size {}", 
             request_id, timestamp, request_size);
    
    // Process the request...
}
```

### Common Pitfalls
- **Pitfall**: Trying to change an immutable variable.
  - **Solution**: Either use `mut` (if the value needs to change) or use shadowing (if you want a new variable with the same name).
- **Pitfall**: Declaring many variables with `let` when they could be grouped.
  - **Solution**: Use tuple destructuring for related values: `let (x, y) = (1, 2);`
- **Pitfall**: Assuming Rust variables behave like variables in other languages.
  - **Solution**: Understand that Rust's immutability-by-default is intentional for safety.

### Confusion Questions with Answers
1. **Q**: Why would I want immutable variables by default?
   **A**: Immutability prevents bugs by ensuring values don't change unexpectedly. It also enables compiler optimizations and is fundamental to Rust's safety guarantees and concurrency model.

2. **Q**: If I can't change variables, how do I work with changing data?
   **A**: You have three options: (1) use `mut` for truly mutable variables, (2) use shadowing to create a new variable with the same name, or (3) use data structures designed for mutation, like `Cell` or `RefCell`.

3. **Q**: Why does Rust use `let` instead of just declaring variables with their type?
   **A**: The `let` keyword clearly marks the introduction of a new variable, improving readability. It also works with Rust's powerful type inference system, making explicit types often unnecessary.

---

## 2. Mutability with `mut`

### Concise Explanation
When you need a variable whose value can change, use the `mut` keyword. This explicitly marks the variable as mutable, making your intentions clear to both the compiler and other developers reading your code.

### Where to Use
- Counter variables that need to be incremented
- Buffers that will be filled with data
- Values that need to be updated during processing
- When implementing algorithms that modify variables in place

### Code Snippet
```rust
fn main() {
    // Mutable variable declaration
    let mut counter = 0;
    println!("Initial counter: {}", counter);
    
    // Now we can modify it
    counter += 1;
    println!("Updated counter: {}", counter);
    
    // Mutable strings
    let mut message = String::from("Hello");
    message.push_str(", world!");
    println!("{}", message); // "Hello, world!"
}
```

### Real-World Example
A function that processes text and counts word occurrences:

```rust
fn count_words(text: &str) -> std::collections::HashMap<String, usize> {
    let mut word_counts = std::collections::HashMap::new();
    
    for word in text.split_whitespace() {
        let word = word.to_lowercase();
        let count = word_counts.entry(word).or_insert(0);
        *count += 1;
    }
    
    word_counts
}
```

### Common Pitfalls
- **Pitfall**: Making too many variables mutable.
  - **Solution**: Only use `mut` when a variable genuinely needs to change; prefer immutability when possible.
- **Pitfall**: Forgetting that mutability is not transitive.
  - **Solution**: Remember that `let mut x = y;` means `x` is mutable, not that the data it points to is mutable.
- **Pitfall**: Mutability and borrowing conflicts.
  - **Solution**: Understand that you can have either one mutable reference or many immutable references, but not both.

### Confusion Questions with Answers
1. **Q**: Does `mut` mean I can change a variable's type?
   **A**: No. `mut` only allows changing the value, not the type. The type is fixed at compile time.

2. **Q**: If I create a mutable reference to an immutable variable, can I modify the variable?
   **A**: No. You cannot create a mutable reference to an immutable variable. The compiler will prevent this.

3. **Q**: Does making a variable mutable affect performance?
   **A**: Generally no. The `mut` keyword is primarily for the compiler's analysis and doesn't typically affect the generated machine code. However, it can enable certain compiler optimizations in specific cases.

---

## 3. Constants with `const`

### Concise Explanation
Constants (`const`) are values that are fixed at compile time and never change. Unlike variables, constants:
- Must always have an explicit type annotation
- Can be declared in any scope, including global scope
- Must be set to a constant expression (calculable at compile time)
- By convention, are named using SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE

### Where to Use
- For values that are used throughout your program
- Mathematical constants (Ï€, e, etc.)
- Configuration values that never change
- Maximum/minimum values for algorithms
- Magic numbers that need meaningful names

### Code Snippet
```rust
// Global constants
const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100_000;
const PI: f64 = 3.14159265359;

fn main() {
    // Local constant
    const SECONDS_IN_HOUR: u32 = 60 * 60;
    
    println!("You can earn up to {} points", MAX_POINTS);
    
    // Constants in expressions
    let radius = 5.0;
    let area = PI * radius * radius;
    println!("Circle area: {}", area);
    
    // Using numeric separators for readability
    const BILLION: u64 = 1_000_000_000;
    println!("One billion: {}", BILLION);
}
```

### Real-World Example
A game that defines game mechanics constants:

```rust
const GRAVITY: f32 = 9.81;
const MAX_HEALTH: u32 = 100;
const PLAYER_SPEED: f32 = 2.5;
const ENEMY_SPAWN_RATE: f32 = 0.02;

fn update_player_position(position: &mut f32, velocity: f32, time_delta: f32) {
    // Use the constant in calculation
    *position += velocity * PLAYER_SPEED * time_delta;
}
```

### Common Pitfalls
- **Pitfall**: Trying to set a constant to a value computed at runtime.
  - **Solution**: Constants must be evaluable at compile time. Use `static` (with caution) if you need runtime initialization.
- **Pitfall**: Using lowercase names for constants.
  - **Solution**: Follow the convention: use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants.
- **Pitfall**: Redefining constants locally when they should be program-wide.
  - **Solution**: Place widely-used constants at the module level or in a dedicated `constants.rs` file.

### Confusion Questions with Answers
1. **Q**: What's the difference between an immutable variable and a constant?
   **A**: Three key differences: (1) constants require type annotations, (2) constants can only be set to compile-time expressions, and (3) constants can be declared in the global scope. Additionally, constants are inlined at compile time wherever they're used.

2. **Q**: Can I use functions or runtime values in a constant?
   **A**: No. Constants must be evaluable at compile time. You can use const functions, but not regular functions or any value determined at runtime.

3. **Q**: Why use numeric separators like `1_000_000` instead of `1000000`?
   **A**: Numeric separators (`_`) improve readability without changing the value. They can be placed anywhere in a number literal and are ignored by the compiler.

---

## 4. Shadowing

### Concise Explanation
Shadowing is declaring a new variable with the same name as an existing variable. The new variable "shadows" the previous one, taking over its name within its scope. Unlike mutation, shadowing allows changing both the value and the type while reusing the same variable name.

### Where to Use
- When converting a value to a different type but keeping the same name
- When the meaning of a variable changes, but the name is still appropriate
- To avoid creating multiple similarly named variables (e.g., `input`, `parsed_input`)
- In data transformation pipelines where a value goes through multiple stages

### Code Snippet
```rust
fn main() {
    // Basic shadowing
    let x = 5;
    println!("x is: {}", x);  // 5
    
    let x = x + 1;
    println!("x is: {}", x);  // 6
    
    // Shadowing in inner scope
    {
        let x = x * 2;
        println!("x in inner scope is: {}", x);  // 12
    }
    
    println!("x is: {}", x);  // 6 (outer value remains)
    
    // Shadowing with different types
    let spaces = "   ";
    let spaces = spaces.len();
    println!("spaces: {}", spaces);  // 3
    
    // This would NOT work with mut:
    // let mut spaces = "   ";
    // spaces = spaces.len(); // Error: mismatched types
}
```

### Real-World Example
Processing user input where the same data transforms from string to parsed values:

```rust
fn process_user_input(input: &str) -> Result<u32, std::num::ParseIntError> {
    // Start with the raw input
    let input = input.trim();  // Shadow to remove whitespace
    
    // Shadow again to convert to uppercase
    let input = input.to_uppercase();
    
    // Shadow again with a different type - convert string to number
    let input = input.parse::<u32>()?;
    
    // Use the final transformed value
    Ok(input * 2)
}
```

### Common Pitfalls
- **Pitfall**: Confusing shadowing with mutation.
  - **Solution**: Remember that shadowing creates a new variable, while mutation changes an existing one.
- **Pitfall**: Accidentally shadowing a variable and losing access to the original.
  - **Solution**: Be mindful of scope and ensure shadowing is intentional.
- **Pitfall**: Overusing shadowing and making code hard to follow.
  - **Solution**: Use shadowing when it increases clarity, not just to reuse names.

### Confusion Questions with Answers
1. **Q**: If shadowing creates a new variable, does it affect memory usage?
   **A**: Yes, but minimally. Shadowing creates a new variable in memory, but the old one becomes inaccessible and is eligible for cleanup. The compiler is good at optimizing this.

2. **Q**: What's the difference between `let x = x + 1` and `x += 1`?
   **A**: `let x = x + 1` creates a new variable that shadows the old one, while `x += 1` mutates the existing variable (requires `mut`). Shadowing creates a new immutable variable, whereas `+=` requires mutability.

3. **Q**: Does shadowing work across function boundaries?
   **A**: No. Shadowing only works within the same scope or in nested inner scopes. Each function has its own independent scope.

## 5. Naming Conventions

### Concise Explanation
Rust has established naming conventions that, while not enforced by the compiler, are strongly encouraged in the community. Following these conventions makes your code more readable and idiomatic.

### Where to Use
- Throughout your code for consistency
- In public APIs for better usability
- When contributing to Rust projects
- When publishing crates to crates.io

### Code Snippet
```rust
// Basic naming conventions in practice
fn main() {
    // Variables and function parameters: snake_case
    let user_id = 42;
    let item_count = 100;
    
    // Functions: snake_case
    calculate_total(item_count);
    
    // Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
    const MAX_CONNECTIONS: u32 = 100;
    
    // Types (structs, enums, traits): PascalCase
    let user = User { id: user_id, name: "Alice".to_string() };
    let status = Status::Active;
    
    // Modules: snake_case
    use std::collections::HashMap;
    
    // Macros: snake_case! (with exclamation mark)
    println!("Hello, {}", user.name);
}

// Function: snake_case
fn calculate_total(count: u32) -> u32 {
    count * 2
}

// Type: PascalCase
struct User {
    id: u32,
    name: String,
}

// Enum: PascalCase (variants also PascalCase)
enum Status {
    Active,
    Inactive,
    Pending,
}
```

### Real-World Example
A library with idiomatic naming:

```rust
pub mod file_utils {
    // Type (struct) in PascalCase
    pub struct FileInfo {
        pub name: String,
        pub size_in_bytes: u64,
        // Using snake_case for field names
    }
    
    // Constant in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
    pub const MAX_FILE_SIZE: u64 = 10_000_000;
    
    // Function in snake_case
    pub fn get_file_info(path: &str) -> Option<FileInfo> {
        // Local variable in snake_case
        let file_path = std::path::Path::new(path);
        
        // Implementation...
        None
    }
    
    // Type (enum) in PascalCase, variants in PascalCase
    pub enum FileType {
        Text,
        Binary,
        Directory,
        Symlink,
    }
}
```

### Common Pitfalls
- **Pitfall**: Using camelCase instead of snake_case for variables.
  - **Solution**: Follow Rust's convention: use snake_case for variables, functions, and methods.
- **Pitfall**: Using lowercase for type names.
  - **Solution**: Use PascalCase for types: structs, enums, traits, and type aliases.
- **Pitfall**: Using inconsistent naming styles within a project.
  - **Solution**: Follow the established patterns and run `cargo fmt` to catch some naming issues.

### Confusion Questions with Answers
1. **Q**: Why does Rust use snake_case for most identifiers when many languages use camelCase?
   **A**: This was a design choice for Rust to improve readability. snake_case tends to be easier to read for many developers, especially for longer names. The important thing is consistency within the language.

2. **Q**: Are these naming conventions enforced by the compiler?
   **A**: No, they're conventions, not rules. The compiler won't stop you from using camelCase for a function, but tools like Clippy may warn you, and your code will look non-idiomatic to Rust developers.

3. **Q**: What naming convention should I use for acronyms in type names?
   **A**: In PascalCase types, capitalize only the first letter of the acronym: `HttpResponse` rather than `HTTPResponse`. For SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE constants, keep the whole acronym uppercase: `HTTP_TIMEOUT`.

## 6. Variable Scope

### Concise Explanation
In Rust, a variable's scope is the range of code where the variable is valid and can be used. Scopes are primarily defined by blocks of code enclosed in curly braces `{}`. When a variable goes out of scope, Rust automatically frees its resources (memory deallocation), a feature known as Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII).

### Where to Use
- To limit the lifetime of variables
- To free resources as soon as they're no longer needed
- To create temporary variables for specific operations
- To avoid naming conflicts with existing variables

### Code Snippet
```rust
fn main() {
    // Outer scope
    let x = 5;
    
    {
        // Inner scope
        let y = 10;
        
        // Both x and y are accessible here
        println!("x: {}, y: {}", x, y);
        
        // Variable z only exists in this block
        let z = x + y;
        println!("z: {}", z);
    } // y and z go out of scope and are dropped here
    
    // x is still valid
    println!("x: {}", x);
    
    // This would cause a compile error:
    // println!("y: {}", y); // Error: cannot find value `y` in this scope
    
    // Function scope example
    let name = "Alice";
    print_greeting(name);
    
    // name is still valid here
    println!("Name in main: {}", name);
}

fn print_greeting(user_name: &str) {
    // user_name is in scope within this function
    println!("Hello, {}!", user_name);
    
    // Local variable only in this function's scope
    let greeting = format!("Welcome, {}", user_name);
    println!("{}", greeting);
} // user_name and greeting go out of scope
```

### Real-World Example
Scoped resource management with a database connection:

```rust
fn process_data() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Connection variable is scoped to this function
    let conn = establish_connection()?;
    
    {
        // Transaction scope
        let transaction = conn.begin_transaction()?;
        
        // Perform operations within the transaction
        transaction.execute("UPDATE users SET status = 'active'")?;
        
        // Commit the transaction
        transaction.commit()?;
    } // Transaction is automatically dropped here
    
    // Connection is still valid
    let count = conn.query_one("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users")?;
    println!("User count: {}", count);
    
    Ok(())
} // Connection is automatically closed when it goes out of scope
```

### Common Pitfalls
- **Pitfall**: Creating variables in a scope where they become inaccessible when needed.
  - **Solution**: Define variables at the appropriate scope level where they'll be accessible throughout their needed lifetime.
- **Pitfall**: Not realizing that resources are freed immediately when a variable goes out of scope.
  - **Solution**: Be intentional about scope boundaries to ensure resources are held for exactly as long as needed.
- **Pitfall**: Creating unnecessarily large scopes for variables.
  - **Solution**: Limit variable scope to exactly where it's needed to free resources earlier and reduce the chance of errors.

### Confusion Questions with Answers
1. **Q**: What happens to allocated memory when a variable goes out of scope?
   **A**: Rust automatically deallocates the memory when the variable goes out of scope. For simple types, this is straightforward. For types that own resources (like `String`), the `Drop` trait is implemented to ensure proper cleanup.

2. **Q**: Can I access a variable declared in an inner scope from an outer scope?
   **A**: No. Variables are only accessible within the scope they are declared and any nested inner scopes. Once the inner scope ends, those variables are no longer accessible.

3. **Q**: How do scopes interact with Rust's ownership system?
   **A**: Scopes are fundamental to ownership. When a variable goes out of scope, Rust calls its `drop` function, freeing any resources. This prevents resource leaks and is part of how Rust guarantees memory safety without a garbage collector.

## 7. Default Values

### Concise Explanation
Rust doesn't automatically assign default values to variablesâ€”they must be explicitly initialized before use. However, Rust provides ways to handle optional values and set defaults when needed, particularly through the `Option` type and the `unwrap_or` and `unwrap_or_default` methods.

### Where to Use
- When a value might not exist (use `Option<T>`)
- When providing fallback values for configurations
- When handling user input that might be missing
- When defining struct fields with common defaults

### Code Snippet
```rust
fn main() {
    // Basic explicit initialization (required)
    let x = 5;
    
    // Option type for possible missing values
    let optional_value: Option<i32> = Some(10);
    
    // Getting a value with a default
    let value = optional_value.unwrap_or(0);
    println!("Value: {}", value);  // 10
    
    // When optional_value is None, provide default
    let optional_value: Option<i32> = None;
    let value = optional_value.unwrap_or(0);
    println!("Value: {}", value);  // 0
    
    // Using unwrap_or_default() - uses the type's Default implementation
    let optional_string: Option<String> = None;
    let string_value = optional_string.unwrap_or_default();
    println!("String: '{}'", string_value);  // Empty string
    
    // Default trait for custom types
    let point = Point::default();
    println!("Default point: ({}, {})", point.x, point.y);  // (0, 0)
}

// Implementing Default for custom types
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

impl Default for Point {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Point { x: 0, y: 0 }
    }
}

// Struct with default values for some fields
struct Config {
    hostname: String,
    port: u16,
    max_connections: u32,
    timeout_seconds: u32,
}

impl Config {
    // Constructor with defaults
    fn new(hostname: String) -> Self {
        Config {
            hostname,
            port: 8080,          // Default port
            max_connections: 100, // Default max connections
            timeout_seconds: 30,  // Default timeout
        }
    }
}
```

### Real-World Example
Configuration handling with defaults:

```rust
struct DatabaseConfig {
    host: String,
    port: u16,
    username: String,
    password: String,
    pool_size: u32,
    connection_timeout: u64,
}

impl DatabaseConfig {
    fn new(host: String, username: String, password: String) -> Self {
        // Required fields provided, optional ones get defaults
        DatabaseConfig {
            host,
            username,
            password,
            port: 5432,          // Default PostgreSQL port
            pool_size: 10,        // Default pool size
            connection_timeout: 30, // Default timeout in seconds
        }
    }
    
    // Builder pattern for optional customization
    fn with_port(mut self, port: u16) -> Self {
        self.port = port;
        self
    }
    
    fn with_pool_size(mut self, size: u32) -> Self {
        self.pool_size = size;
        self
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Use with defaults
    let default_config = DatabaseConfig::new(
        "localhost".to_string(),
        "user".to_string(),
        "password".to_string()
    );
    
    // Override some defaults
    let custom_config = DatabaseConfig::new(
        "db.example.com".to_string(),
        "admin".to_string(),
        "secure_password".to_string()
    )
    .with_port(3306)  // Use MySQL port instead
    .with_pool_size(25);  // Larger connection pool
}
```

### Common Pitfalls
- **Pitfall**: Assuming variables have default values like in some other languages.
  - **Solution**: Always initialize variables before use; Rust requires this.
- **Pitfall**: Using `.unwrap()` on `Option` types that might be `None`.
  - **Solution**: Use `.unwrap_or()` or `.unwrap_or_default()` to provide a fallback value.
- **Pitfall**: Reimplementing default value logic inconsistently across code.
  - **Solution**: Implement the `Default` trait for your types and use it consistently.

### Confusion Questions with Answers
1. **Q**: Why doesn't Rust provide default values for variables like some other languages?
   **A**: This is a design choice for safety and explicitness. Automatic default values can hide bugs when a programmer forgets to initialize a variable. Rust prefers to catch these issues at compile time.

2. **Q**: What's the difference between `unwrap_or()` and `unwrap_or_default()`?
   **A**: `unwrap_or()` takes an explicit default value as an argument. `unwrap_or_default()` doesn't take an argument but instead uses the `Default` implementation for the type inside the `Option`.

3. **Q**: Can I make a struct field optional with a default value?
   **A**: Not directly in the struct definition. You have several options: implement `Default` for the entire struct, use a builder pattern with defaults, use `Option<T>` for truly optional fields, or provide a constructor function that sets defaults.

## 8. Type Inference

### Concise Explanation
Rust has a powerful type inference system that can deduce types based on how variables are used, reducing the need for explicit type annotations. However, there are cases where explicit type annotations are necessary or beneficial for clarity.

### Where to Use
- For most variable declarations, let the compiler infer the type
- Provide explicit types for function parameters and return values
- Add type annotations when the compiler can't determine the type
- Use explicit types to guide the compiler when multiple types are possible

### Code Snippet
```rust
fn main() {
    // Basic type inference
    let x = 5;         // Inferred as i32
    let y = 2.0;       // Inferred as f64
    let active = true; // Inferred as bool
    
    // Compiler needs help with empty collections
    let numbers: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
    
    // Type can be inferred from usage
    let mut names = Vec::new();
    names.push("Alice");  // Now Vec<&str> is inferred
    
    // Multiple possible numeric types need annotation
    let small_number: u8 = 100;
    
    // Type inference with generics
    let coords = (10, 20);  // Inferred as (i32, i32)
    let coords: (f32, f32) = (10.5, 20.5);  // Explicit tuple types
    
    // Complex example with inference
    let scores = vec![("Alice", 100), ("Bob", 85), ("Charlie", 90)];
    // Inferred as Vec<(&str, i32)>
    
    // Inference with functions
    let sum = add(5, 10);  // Return type inferred from function
    
    // Without turbofish, the parse method can't know which type to convert to
    let parsed: i32 = "42".parse().unwrap();
    
    // With turbofish syntax: explicit type in method call
    let parsed = "42".parse::<i32>().unwrap();
}

// For functions, parameter and return types must be explicit
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

// Generics with type constraints
fn largest<T: PartialOrd>(list: &[T]) -> &T {
    let mut largest = &list[0];
    
    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }
    
    largest
}
```

### Real-World Example
Type inference in data processing pipeline:

```rust
fn process_data(input: &str) -> Result<Vec<String>, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Type inference for the complex map/filter pipeline
    let results = input
        .lines()
        .filter(|line| !line.is_empty())
        .map(|line| line.trim())
        .filter(|line| !line.starts_with("#"))
        .map(|line| {
            // Process the line - types inferred throughout
            let parts: Vec<_> = line.split(',').collect();
            if parts.len() < 2 {
                return Err("Invalid format".into());
            }
            
            let name = parts[0].to_string();
            let value = parts[1].parse::<i32>()?;
            
            Ok(format!("{}: {}", name, value * 2))
        })
        .collect::<Result<Vec<_>, _>>()?;
    
    Ok(results)
}
```

### Common Pitfalls
- **Pitfall**: Not providing type annotations for empty collections.
  - **Solution**: Use annotations like `let v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();` or use the turbofish syntax: `let v = Vec::<i32>::new();`
- **Pitfall**: Expecting the compiler to infer numeric literals as specific types.
  - **Solution**: Add type annotations for numeric types when specific sizes are needed: `let x: u8 = 42;`
- **Pitfall**: Missing type annotations in places where multiple types are possible.
  - **Solution**: Use explicit type annotations or turbofish syntax to guide the compiler.

### Confusion Questions with Answers
1. **Q**: If Rust can infer types, why do I need to annotate function parameters and return types?
   **A**: Function signatures form a contract that's part of the public API. Explicit types make this contract clear to both the compiler and developers. It also enables separate compilation and better error messages.

2. **Q**: What is the "turbofish" syntax and when should I use it?
   **A**: The turbofish syntax (`::<>`) provides explicit type parameters to generic functions or methods, like `"42".parse::<i32>()`. Use it when the compiler needs help determining which specific type to use for a generic parameter.

3. **Q**: How does Rust decide which numeric type to infer for literals?
   **A**: By default, Rust infers `i32` for integers and `f64` for floating-point numbers. If the context requires a different type (like assigning to a variable with a known type), Rust will use that type if possible.

## Next Actions: Exercises and Projects

### Exercises
1. **Variable Declaration Practice**
   - Create variables of different types and print them
   - Experiment with mutability by changing values
   - Use shadowing to transform a value through multiple steps

2. **Constant and Naming Convention Practice**
   - Create a program with properly named constants for configuration
   - Implement a function that uses these constants
   - Follow Rust naming conventions throughout

3. **Scope Exploration**
   - Write a program with nested scopes
   - Observe how variables go out of scope
   - Experiment with trying to access variables after they're out of scope

4. **Type Inference Challenge**
   - Write a program where you omit as many type annotations as possible
   - Add annotations only where required
   - Document where and why type annotations were necessary

### Micro-Project: Temperature Converter with Configuration
Build a temperature converter that:
- Uses constants for conversion formulas
- Employs proper variable scoping
- Demonstrates shadowing for transforming input
- Follows Rust naming conventions
- Uses type inference appropriately
- Provides default values for optional settings

```rust
// Example starter code
const FAHRENHEIT_OFFSET: f64 = 32.0;
const CELSIUS_TO_FAHRENHEIT_FACTOR: f64 = 9.0 / 5.0;
const FAHRENHEIT_TO_CELSIUS_FACTOR: f64 = 5.0 / 9.0;

struct ConverterConfig {
    decimal_places: usize,
    include_unit_symbol: bool,
}

impl Default for ConverterConfig {
    fn default() -> Self {
        ConverterConfig {
            decimal_places: 2,
            include_unit_symbol: true,
        }
    }
}

fn celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius: f64) -> f64 {
    celsius * CELSIUS_TO_FAHRENHEIT_FACTOR + FAHRENHEIT_OFFSET
}

fn fahrenheit_to_celsius(fahrenheit: f64) -> f64 {
    (fahrenheit - FAHRENHEIT_OFFSET) * FAHRENHEIT_TO_CELSIUS_FACTOR
}

// Complete the implementation...
```

## Success Criteria
You've mastered variables and constants in Rust when you can:
1. Correctly declare and use variables with appropriate mutability
2. Apply shadowing effectively to transform values while reusing names
3. Define and use constants according to Rust conventions
4. Understand and manage variable scope and lifetimes
5. Use type inference appropriately, adding annotations where necessary
6. Follow Rust naming conventions consistently
7. Provide default values when appropriate using idiomatic Rust approaches

## Troubleshooting Advice
1. **Mutability Issues**
   - If you get "cannot assign twice to immutable variable," either:
     - Add `mut` if the variable genuinely needs to change
     - Use shadowing (`let x = ...`) if you're creating a new value
   - Remember that mutability is a property of the binding, not the value

2. **Scope Problems**
   - If a variable is "not found in this scope," check:
     - Was it declared in a different (inner) scope that has ended?
     - Is it shadowed by another variable with the same name?
     - Have you imported it correctly if it's from another module?
   - Use the `dbg!` macro to print variable values and their scope

3. **Type Inference Challenges**
   - If you get "type annotations needed," provide explicit types where required:
     - Empty collections need type annotations
     - Functions with generic return types may need turbofish syntax
     - Numeric literals may need annotations for specific sizes
   - Use the error messages as guidanceâ€”Rust often suggests fixes

4. **Constant Evaluation Errors**
   - If a constant "cannot be evaluated at compile-time," ensure:
     - You're using only compile-time expressions (no function calls)
     - All values are available at compile time
     - Consider using `lazy_static` if truly runtime initialization is needed

5. **Naming Convention Warnings**
   - If Clippy warns about naming conventions:
     - Variables and functions should use `snake_case`
     - Types (structs, enums) should use `PascalCase`
     - Constants should use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
   - Run `cargo clippy` regularly to catch these issues
